<h1 class="headline-large">What's a mint?</h1>
<p>
    A mint is similar to a banking institution; it provides convenience and
    defends your online privacy as you spend and receive bitcoin.

            <h1 class="title-medium">A mint is a custodian</h1>
            <p>
                Like all custodial services, a mint is 
                susceptible to loss of customer funds.

            <h1 class="title-medium">Custodians require trust</h1>
            <p>
                Mints rely on reputation to establish trust. 
                Customers must trust custodians to secure 
                and facilitate payments, and to minimise 
                counterparty risk on their behalf.

            <h1 class="title-medium">Mints defend your privacy</h1>
            <p>
                Mints operate without collecting your 
                personal information or asking for 
                registration; why should it? Mints don't 
                keep track of your balance, your device 
                does.

            <h1 class="title-medium">Mints are impartial</h1>
            <p>
                Unlike other custodians, a mint cannot 
                target you, or freeze or restrict access to 
                your funds. Mints don't know who you are, 
                nor how wealthy you might be.
